### Assembly Language Programming (x86 & x86-64)

1. Introduction to Assembly Language
    - 1.1 What is Assembly Language?
    - 1.2 Where is Assembly Used Today?
    - 1.3 From High-Level Languages to Machine Code
    - 1.4 Understanding Machine Code vs. Assembly Code
    - 1.5 The CPU: Registers, ALU, and Control Unit
    - 1.6 The x86 and x86-64 CPU Architecture

2. Setting Up Assembly Programming Environment
    - 2.1 Choosing an Assembler (NASM, MASM, GAS, etc.)
    - 2.2 Installing Required Tools (Assembler, Linker, Editor, Debugger)
    - 2.3 Writing and Running Your First Assembly Program (Hello World)
    - 2.4 Assembling, Linking, and Running Programs
    - 2.5 Common Errors

3. Structure and Syntax of Assembly Programs
    - 3.1 The Structure of an Assembly Program
    - 3.2 Sections (.data, .bss, .text, etc.)
    - 3.3 Instruction Format (Mnemonics, Operands)
    - 3.4 Comments and Documentation
    - 3.5 Defining Data (db, dw, dd, dq, etc.)
    - 3.6 Constants and Variables

4. Registers and Addressing Modes
    - 4.1 Registers in x86 and x86-64
        - General Purpose Registers
        - Special Purpose Registers (EIP/RIP, FLAGS, etc.)
    - 4.2 Addressing Modes
        - Immediate
        - Register
        - Direct/Memory
        - Indexed/Indirect

6. Control Flow
    - 6.1 Unconditional Jumps
    - 6.2 Conditional Jumps (JE, JNE, JG, JL, etc.)
    - 6.3 Comparing Values (CMP, TEST)
    - 6.4 Looping Constructs (LOOP, JCXZ, etc.)
    - 6.5 Implementing if/else, switch/case, and loops

7. Procedures, Functions, and the Stack
    - 7.1 Introduction to Procedures and Functions
