# 1. Introduction to Assembly Language

Assembly language is an entry point into how computers work. With assembly, you get to close look at software, at how the CPU actually runs the instructions. 


## 1.1 What is Assembly Language?

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides a symbolic representation of a computerâ€™s machine code instructions. Unlike high-level languages (like Python or C), assembly is closely tied to the hardware, allowing programmers to write instructions that the CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes directly.

- **Human-readable:** Uses mnemonic codes (like MOV, ADD, SUB) instead of binary.
- **Hardware-specific:** Each CPU family has its own assembly language.


## 1.2 Where is Assembly Used Today?

While most people use high-level languages, assembly is still important and widely used in:

- **Operating systems:** For direct hardware access and efficiency.
- **Embedded systems:** Where resources are limited and control is crucial.
- **Performance-critical routines:** For maximum speed (e.g., graphics, cryptography).
- **Reverse engineering and security:** Understanding how software works, analyzing malware.


## 1.3 From High-Level Languages to Machine Code

Computers only understand simple instructions, written as numbers. When you write a program in a language like C or Python, the computer can't understand it directly. Here's what usually happens:
When you write a program in a high-level language (like C), it goes through several steps before it runs on your computer:

1. **Source code** (C, Python, etc.)
2. **Compiler or interpreter** converts source code to:
    - **Assembly code** (sometimes, as an intermediate step)
    - Or directly to **machine code** (numeric instructions)
3. **Assembler** translates assembly code to machine code (object file).
4. **Linker** combines object files into an executable program.
5. **CPU** executes the machine code.


## 1.5 Understanding Machine Code vs. Assembly Code

- **Machine code:** The real instructions the CPU runs, written as numbers. Hard for programmers to read or write.
- **Assembly code:** Symbolic, readable form of machine instructions, using mnemonics.

Assembly is translated into machine code by a program called an **assembler**.


## 1.7 The CPU: Registers, ALU, and Control Unit

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the "brain" of the computer, and its main components are:

- **Registers:** Tiny, very fast storage locations inside the CPU.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Control Unit:** Directs the operations of the CPU.

Assembly programming often involves moving data between registers and memory, and performing operations using the ALU.

## 1.8 The x86/x86-64 CPU Architecture Overview

- **x86:** Refers to the 32-bit Intel architecture (with registers named `EAX`, `EBX`, etc.).
- **x86-64 (or AMD64):** The 64-bit extension, with larger registers (`RAX`, `RBX`, etc.) and more of them.
- **General-purpose registers:** Used for arithmetic, logic, and data movement.
- **Special-purpose registers:** For stack operations, instruction pointers, etc.
- **Rich instruction set:** Includes data movement, arithmetic, logic, and control flow commands.
