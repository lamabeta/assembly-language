# Registers Cheat Sheet
### What are registers?
Registers are small, fast storage locations inside the CPU used to perform operations and hold data.

## General-Purpose Registers (GPRs)

These registers are used for arithmetic, data movement, and logic operations. Each register can be accessed in different sizes: 64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit. For 8-bit registers, the lower and higher halves are separately accessible.

### **Flags Register**
The Flags Register (RFLAGS in 64-bit mode) contains status and control flags used by the CPU.

| **Flag**    | **Label**      | **Bit** | **Purpose**                                                                             |
|-------------|-------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CF** |Carry Flag   | 0       | Set if an arithmetic operation generates a carry/borrow.                                        |
| **ZF** |Zero Flag    | 6       | Set if the result of an operation is zero.                                                       |
| **SF**| Sign Flag    | 7       | Set if the result is negative.                                                                   |
| **OF** |Overflow Flag| 11      | Set if an arithmetic operation overflows a signed number.                                        |
| **PF**| Parity Flag  | 2       | Set if the number of set bits in the result is even.                                             |
| **AF** |Auxiliary Flag | 4     | Used in BCD (binary-coded decimal) operations.                                                   |
| **DF**| Direction Flag| 10     | Determines string operation direction (`0` = increment, `1` = decrement).                        |
| **IF** |Interrupt Flag | 9       | Enables (`1`) or disables (`0`) maskable hardware interrupts.                                    |
