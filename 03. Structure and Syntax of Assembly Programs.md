# 3. Structure and Syntax of Assembly Programs

Assembly language programs have a certain structure and use special words and symbols. Understanding this structure helps you write clear and correct programs.

## 2.1 The Structure of an Assembly Program

An assembly program is made up of **sections** and **instructions**.  
Most assembly programs follow this pattern:

1. **Data Section:** Where you store messages, numbers, and other data.
2. **Code Section:** Where you write the instructions (the actual program).
3. **(Optional) BSS Section:** For uninitialized variables.

**Order matters:** The program usually starts in the code section.

```assembly
section .data     ; Data section
section .bss      ; Uninitialized data section
section .text     ; Code (instructions) section
```


## 2.2 Sections (.data, .bss, .text, etc.)

Sections help you organize your program:

- **.data**  
  For data that you set at the beginning (like messages or numbers).
  ```assembly
  section .data
      number db 5
      name db "Alice", 0
  ```

- **.bss**  
  For variables that you want to create space for, but don’t give a value yet.
  ```assembly
  section .bss
      buffer resb 64    ; Reserve 64 bytes
  ```

- **.text**  
  For your actual program instructions (the code that runs).
  ```assembly
  section .text
      global _start
      _start:
          ; Your code here
  ```


## 2.3 Instruction Format (Mnemonics, Operands)

Each line of assembly code is called an **instruction**.  
Instructions usually have two parts:

1. **Mnemonic:** The command (like `mov`, `add`, `jmp`).
2. **Operands:** The data or registers you want to use with the command.

**Example:**  
```assembly
mov eax, 5
```
- `mov` is the mnemonic (it means “move”).
- `eax` and `5` are the operands (move the number 5 into the register called eax).

The instructions may have one or more operands or none at all.


## 2.4 Comments and Documentation

**Comments** are notes you add to your code to explain what it does. They are ignored by the assembler, but help humans understand the program.

- In NASM and most assemblers, comments start with a semicolon `;`

**Example:**
```assembly
mov eax, 1      ; Put the value 1 into register eax
```


## 2.5 Defining Data (db, dw, dd, dq, etc.)

You use special keywords to tell the assembler what kind of data you want:

- **db** (define byte): 1 byte (8 bits)
- **dw** (define word): 2 bytes (16 bits)
- **dd** (define double word): 4 bytes (32 bits)
- **dq** (define quad word): 8 bytes (64 bits)

**Examples:**
```assembly
num1 db 10         ; 1 byte, value 10
num2 dw 1000       ; 2 bytes, value 1000
num3 dd 123456     ; 4 bytes, value 123456
num4 dq 123456789  ; 8 bytes, value 123456789
```


## 2.6 Constants and Variables

- **Constants** are values that do **not** change while the program runs.  
  Example:  
  ```assembly
  pi db 3.14
  maxValue equ 255   ; 'equ' means 'equals', a constant value
  ```

- **Variables** are areas in memory where you can change the value as the program runs.
  - In the `.data` section, giving an initial value makes a variable.
  - In the `.bss` section, you create empty space for variables.

**Examples:**
```assembly
section .data
    counter db 0     ; Variable that starts at 0

section .bss
    temp resb 1      ; Reserve 1 byte for a variable
```
